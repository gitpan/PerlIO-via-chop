This is the README file for PerlIO::via::chop, a rather simple
PerlIO filter to chop off the last byte outputted to the file.

It has no effect whatsoever when used on a input filehandle.

Believe it or not, this has real-world practical uses.

* Installation

PerlIO::via::chop uses the standard perl module install process:

cpansign -v		# see SIGNATURE for details
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
